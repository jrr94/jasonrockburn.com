    <div class="column3surround">
      <div class="column3">
        <p>I am a recent graduate from the University of Pittsburgh with a
        Bachelors degree in engineering science. During my schooling I focused
        in Electrical engineering and received a minor in physics. Engineering
        Science is a broad major that gives a diverse background of knowledge
        including electrical systems and material properties which explain
        crystal structure, magnetic and electrical properties, and fabrication
        methods.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column3">
        <p>School and personal projects have made me an
        exceptional problem solver and analytical thinker. Although my
        background is broad, I am able to learn and apply new information
        quickly. Engineering school above all teaches the art of problem
        solving. Regardless of the problem at hand, I have the abilities and
        drive to self teach the material and apply it to reach the desired result.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column3">
        <p>I am passionate about entreperneurship, innovation,
        and product design. I dream of a career that allows me to use my
        analytical skills mixed with design and creativity to be on the front
        line of cutting edge technology that is geared toward the greater good.

          <h3>XProject PCB</h3>
          <p>
            The PCB  on the left directly plugs into an arduino mega to control a variety
            of things. It was made to integrate a keypad, LCD display,
            bidirectional DC motor, and a buzzer. This design was created from
            multiple different independent designs and integrated with each Other
            to allow full functionality with one PCB plugged directly into the
            arduino MEGA.

          <h3>Laser Diode Driver</h3>
          <p>
            The circuit board on the right was designed in a Lasers and Optics
            course and is designed to use an arduino nano to run a laser Diode.
            The laser diode is driven by a power source and has different
            outputs of the laser given environmental factors such as temperature.
            This circuit is nearly identical to laser diode drivers on the market
            going for about $100 and can be manufactured at about 20% that price.

          <h3>Other/Current Projects</h3>
          <p>
            Other circuits have been designed and are being designed by me
            currently. I have made a multiplexer array that accurately cycles
            through 64 spaces and gives data on whether a magnetic piece is
            present or not for use in an automated chess board. I also
            created a 2 axis step motor grid for that project. I am currently
            attempting to make an arduino uno from scratch and am designing
            the PCB right now. I hope to soon design a project using IOT device
            and solar panels for Voltaic systems blog.

          <h3>XProject 3D AUTOCAD Design</h3>
          <p>The design on the left is the final iteration of the XProject
          3D design. The design is used to hold a servo motor to be mounted
          on the front of the piece in order to move a separately designed
          and tested 'flap' for blocking the nest cam housed on the side.
          The back plate on this design allows for a neopixel to be mounted
          and shows a specified color depending on the state of the system.
          The system was able to block the camera completely, open completely
          as well as have an intermediate state to allow the camera to
          gather video information for a designated interval after blocking
          the camera for a seperately designated interval to allow for partial
          blockage of the camera. On top of this functionality the user is able
          to cut microphone feed and power ot the camera. In the fron of the
          case there is a small slot for an IR sensor to be placed to allow the
          user to toggle states with a remote.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column3">
            <h3>Arduino MEGA Casing with Battery Compartment</h3>
            <p>The design on the right is a snap case designed to hold an
              arduino MEGA as well as a rechargable battery in case the
              arduino became unplugged. This snap case allows for the USB
              cable for the arduino to be plugged in if desired, as well as a
              slot for the power plug to attach to the battery and acoompanying
              circuit to ensure the battery does not overcharge. Air vents were
              added to the top of the snap case to ensure the arduino did not
              have overheating issues. The bottom inside of the case was
              designed with small pins which the arduino would sit directly on
              to make sure the arduino was held in place. The covering for the
              battery enclosure is seperate from that which holds the Arduino
              and is much more easily removed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column3">
          <h3>Smart Chess</h3>
          <p>Not pictured above are multiple simple designs for the smart Chess
            board. For the smart chess project, it was necessary to build
            multiple small connectors for the 2-axis rail system as well
            as a design for the chessboard which was made with a lasercutter.
            Along with the pieces needed to connect the axis system, it was
            necessary to solder together 64 hall effect sensors to attach to
            the Multiplexer pcb board to cycle through states of the board.
            Completing this part of the project greatly improved my soldering
            and electronics organizational skills requiring a compact system
            that would not interfere with the axis or the chess board.</p>
