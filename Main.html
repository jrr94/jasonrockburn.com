      <div class="column3">
        <p>I am a recent graduate from the University of Pittsburgh with a
        Bachelors degree in engineering science. During my schooling I focused
        in Electrical engineering and received a minor in physics. Engineering
        Science is a broad major that gives a diverse background of knowledge
        including electrical systems and material properties which explain
        crystal structure, magnetic and electrical properties, and fabrication
        methods.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column3">
        <p>School and personal projects have made me an
        exceptional problem solver and analytical thinker. Although my
        background is broad, I am able to learn and apply new information
        quickly. Engineering school above all teaches the art of problem
        solving. Regardless of the problem at hand, I have the abilities and
        drive to self teach the material and apply it to reach the desired result.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column3">
        <p>I am passionate about entreperneurship, innovation,
        and product design. I dream of a career that allows me to use my
        analytical skills mixed with design and creativity to be on the front
        line of cutting edge technology that is geared toward the greater good.

          <h3>XProject PCB</h3>
          <p>
            The PCB  on the left directly plugs into an arduino mega to control a variety
            of things. It was made to integrate a keypad, LCD display,
            bidirectional DC motor, and a buzzer. This design was created from
            multiple different independent designs and integrated with each Other
            to allow full functionality with one PCB plugged directly into the
            arduino MEGA.

          <h3>Laser Diode Driver</h3>
          <p>
            The circuit board on the right was designed in a Lasers and Optics
            course and is designed to use an arduino nano to run a laser Diode.
            The laser diode is driven by a power source and has different
            outputs of the laser given environmental factors such as temperature.
            This circuit is nearly identical to laser diode drivers on the market
            going for about $100 and can be manufactured at about 20% that price.

          <h3>Other/Current Projects</h3>
          <p>
            Other circuits have been designed and are being designed by me
            currently. I have made a multiplexer array that accurately cycles
            through 64 spaces and gives data on whether a magnetic piece is
            present or not for use in an automated chess board. I also
            created a 2 axis step motor grid for that project. I am currently
            attempting to make an arduino uno from scratch and am designing
            the PCB right now. I hope to soon design a project using IOT device
            and solar panels for Voltaic systems blog.
